# contributing to my website

if you're reading this, you are probably interested in contributing to my project, which i am very thankful for :)

this document serves as a guide to help you make contributions that we can merge into the [cvssn.github.io](https://cvssn.github.io/) codebase.

## translations

thank you for showing interest in making my website more accessible around the world, we really appreciate it! here are some guidelines for how a translation should look:

- my website's writing style is informal. please do not use formal language, unless there is no other way to express the same idea of the original text in your language.
- all website text is written in lowercase. this is a stylistic choice, please do not capitalize translated sentences.
- **please don't translate into languages which you are not experienced in.** we can use google translate ourselves, but we would prefer to be translated by humans, not computers.

if your language does not exist on the translation platform yet, you can request to add it by adding it to any of website's components

before translating a piece of text, check that no one has made a translation yet. pending translations are displayed in the **suggestions** tab on the translate page. if someone already made a suggestion, and you think it's correct, you can upvote it! this helps us distinguish that a translation is correct.

if no one has submitted a translation, or the submitted translation seems wrong to you, you can submit your translation by clicking the **suggest** button for each individual string, which sends it off for human review. we will then check it to to ensure no malicious translations are submitted, and add it to the project.

if any translation string's meaning seems unclear to you, please leave a comment on the Comments tab, and we will either add an explanation or a screenshot.
