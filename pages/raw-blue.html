            i'm watching you dive <br>
            down with me <br>
            as much as autumn's fallen leaves <br>
            you're everywhere <br>
            piled on me <br>
            you're rustling in so deep <br><br>

            i'm watching you rain over me <br>
            as much as the blue in the sea <br>
            your endless ways over me <br>
            keep crashing into me <br><br>

            while you were out sleeping <br>
            i stayed inside dreaming <br>
            of what we could be <br>
            'cause you're always <br>
            the raw blue in my mind <br>
            you wave over me <br>
            'cause you're always <br><br>

            you are the raw blue <br>
            color me <br>
            you're deep in my soul <br>
            thorn in me <br>
            i'll give you the world <br>
            give me grief <br>
            keep waving over me <br><br>

            show you my fears <br>
            confessing <br>
            drowning <br>
            depressing <br>
            you wave over me <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            a magnetic feel, i recognize you <br>
            created some space, pull me towards you <br>
            closer to the field, but i still pretend <br>
            like i don't know you <br><br>

            keep changing your face, no time to be you <br>
            no time to create, i wonder, do you? <br>
            do you feel the same? searching for mistakes <br>
            letting them destroy you <br><br>

            comes in waves without warning <br>
            that's why i'm lost, and you're not here with me <br>
            collect sadness and be free <br>
            that's why i'm lost, and you're just fantasy <br><br>

            i wish you would stay, if i had to choose <br>
            i'll write down your name, 'cause i'll forget you <br>
            do you feel the same? i don't know what's real? <br>
            i don't know, are you? <br><br>

            comes in waves without warning <br>
            that's why i'm lost, and you're not here with me <br>
            collect sadness and be free <br>
            that's why i'm lost, and you're just fantasy <br><br>

            (comes in waves without warning) <br>
            (that's why i'm lost, and you're not here with me) <br>
            (collect sadness and be free) <br>
            (that's why i'm lost, and you're just fantasy) <br><br>

            (comes in waves without warning) <br>
            (that's why i'm lost, and you're not here with me) <br>
            (collect sadness and be free) <br>
            (that's why i'm lost, and you're just fantasy) <br><br>

            i'm slowing down <br>
            but now the high doesn't phase me <br>
            figure this out <br>
            it's telling, i'm the one changing <br><br>

            wearing our doubts <br>
            i'll show you what i've been saving <br>
            am i too loud? be honest <br>
            what am i saying? <br><br>

            it's my bad mouth, be sound <br>
            hear all the complaining (comes in waves without warning) <br>
            fear i might drown when you're around (that's why i'm lost) <br>
            keeps on draining (and you're not here with me) <br>
            the time is now, your move <br>
            i'll be always waiting (collect sadness and be free) <br>
            i'll make you count, i need you more (that's why i'm lost) <br>
            'cause i'm fading (and you're just fantasy) <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p style="color: white;">
            i can go further <br>
            tears are just water <br>
            swimming alone until fingers prune <br>
            shrugging these shoulders <br>
            cry somewhere colder <br>
            feels like i'm conditioned to lose <br><br>

            moods <br>
            swinging me blue <br>
            upside down my way <br>
            swinging me blue <br><br>

            i can go lower <br>
            digging through folders <br>
            remember things i hold onto <br>
            but i can't go slower <br>
            through triggers grow older <br>
            they are still quick and cut deep too <br><br>

            and every time i think it through <br>
            the broken thoughts can't be explained <br>
            treading water <br>
            can't be saved <br>
            keep asking the questions <br>
            while you're still awake <br>
            keep making suggestions <br>
            on how to feel nothing <br><br><br><br><br>
